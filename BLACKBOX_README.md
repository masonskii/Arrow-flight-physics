# Physics Simulation

This is a physics simulation library that can be used to simulate the motion of objects in 2D. The library includes classes for representing physical objects, such as balls, blocks, and springs. It also includes methods for calculating the forces acting on objects, such as gravity, friction, and air resistance. The library can be used to simulate a variety of physical phenomena, such as projectile motion, bouncing balls, and falling objects.This repository contains the code for a physics simulation. The simulation can be used to simulate the motion of objects, such as balls and arrows.
To use the library, first create an instance of the Physic class. Then, you can set the mass, speed, acceleration, position, radius, color, state, and collision properties of the object. Once you have created the object, you can use the start_flight() method to simulate its motion. The start_flight() method takes three arguments: the speed of the object, the mass of the object, and the launch angle. The method returns a tuple containing the flight time, maximum height, distance traveled, and a list of x and y coordinates of the object's trajectory.

## Getting Started

To get started with the simulation, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can clone the repository and run the following command to start the simulation:

```sh
python main.py
```

The simulation will open a window that shows the motion of the objects. You can use the mouse to move the objects around and the keyboard to change their properties.

## Physics Engine

The physics engine in this simulation uses the following equations to simulate the motion of objects:

* **Newton's Second Law:** The acceleration of an object is equal to the net force acting on the object divided by the mass of the object.
* **Projectile Motion:** The motion of a projectile is governed by the equations of projectile motion.
* **Hooke's Law:** The force exerted by a spring is proportional to the extension of the spring.

## Examples

The following are some examples of what you can do with the simulation:

* You can simulate the motion of a ball being thrown.
* You can simulate the motion of an arrow being shot from a bow.
* You can simulate the motion of a pendulum swinging.
* You can simulate the motion of a spring being stretched.
